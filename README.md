## Description

Haven is a resource management and survival game in the same vein as The Oregon Trail. The goal of the game is to reach Haven safely, before a horde of humanoid coyotes with a penchant for violence, and unquenchable bloodlust catches up to you. During your travels, you must manage your crystals  and Hit Points (HP) to ensure you reach Haven. Along the way, you will be met by many encounters that affect your resources and travel plans.

##The Game

Haven is a single page app built with Angular 2. The player is stored as an object and it's properties are updated using the player service. The player object includes the below stats, as well as game states such as checking how far you've progressed.  Components across the page affect your properties by calling the player service to update the player object appropriately.

###Player Stats

Your **Hit Points** referred to as **HP** is the amount of damage your are able to take.   
**If you reach 0 HP at any point, you lose the game.**

**Speed** affects the **distance** you move per travel action.

**Healing** affects the amount of **HP** you recover while using the rest action or the heal action.

**Gathering** affects the amount of **crystals** you gain while using the gather action.

**Max HP** is the amount of **HP** you can have.   
**You cannot go over your Max HP**.

**Miles to Haven** is the amount of distance you need to travel to reach Haven. **If you make it, you win**

**The horde is 150 days behind you.**
This is the number of days you have to **reach** Haven, otherwise you are 'Coyote chow.


Your **Crystals** are spent whenever you expend energy. Traveling, gathering, and healing all use crystals.

Your **Speed **, **Healing**, and **Gathering** are your attributes.

###Playing the game

Your main actions are **travel**, **gather**, **rest**, or **heal**.

**Travel** moves you closer to Haven, but spends a **day** and **20 crystal**s.

**Gather** increases your crystals, and takes a full **day**.

**Rest** heals your *HP* by a small amount and costs you **1 day**.

**Heal** recovers your **HP**, but costs **30 crystals**.


Along the way, you will encounter landmarks that allow you to **increase one of your stats by 1**. Choose wisely!
